# Andre-Silva-Gusmao-Study-Code-and-Notes
This repository contains the code and notes behind Linkedin courses I am taking. Despite being familiarized and having years of experience with these concepts I want to create a repository and retake courses to teach these concepts in the future. Check andresilvagusmao.github.io or https://github.com/andresilvagusmao/andresilvagusmao.github.io for more info.

Check the paths before running the programs.
